#《███████ Record》
Aachen, 1926.
Within a small church we discovered a medieval document, written in Latin. The hand appears to be that of a priest—one who called himself ███████.
We do not fully understand what his words were meant to convey, but it is clear that this priest sought to deliver a message, even after six centuries had passed.
Below is the translated text:

-Beloved Lord, I am Your faithful servant.
Recently, my heart was broken, for I lost a friend—the dearest gift of my life.
I tried to draw him back from the path of the demon, but I failed.
All I could do was erase his corruption from this world.
Yet he will return—it is only a matter of time.
According to my insight, it shall be in an age far from now, in a world where faith withers.
Therefore I leave this record.
This paper has been blessed by miracle and cannot decay.
And so I entrust to you a sacred relic:

"✟"

Take it, and confront the enemies of God.
My unknown friend, stand in my place, and return █̖̩̜̣͆̓̇̈́̿█͖̫̯̝̘͂͂̽̀̚█͎̫͉͎͓̗͚̙̟̌̐̀͆͗́̃͑͂͆̚█͉͇͓͎̘̙͖̲͚̳͂̓̓͆͌́█̳̥̳̘̔̅͐͊́█͙̣͉̗͚͛͗́͛̊̍͒̍͌̄̚█̣̝̭̖̱̎͊́̔̈́͑̄́͂̏̚█̪̲̗̳̍̀̊̿̽͐̍͊͂̒͗́█̗̪̮̖͕̝͉̔͊͆̃̎̅̃͑̂͌̆ to the side of the Lord, granting him release from the chains of the demon.
