Regarding the Secret Execution Order of 1326, together with all archival materials discovered in Aachen.

# The Aachen Dossier

### Background

In the year 1926, under the mandate of the Holy See,  
a covert team was dispatched to the city of Aachen.  
Their mission: to investigate persistent rumors of a forbidden manuscript  
hidden within the walls of **St. Foillan Church**, a small and often overlooked sanctuary  
standing in the shadow of the great cathedral.

What they discovered surpassed every expectation.  
Within a sealed compartment, untouched by time,  
lay a set of parchments dating back to the year **1326**.  

The documents reveal the truth behind the so-called *Secret Execution Decree of 1326*,  
and cast new light upon the papal bull of **1317**,  
long suspected to have been altered in the official archives.

### Content

This repository contains fragments and translations  
of those manuscripts, preserved for further study.  
While some passages remain undeciphered,  
they stand as a testimony to an unrecorded history â€”  
one the Church never intended to be read.

### Warning

The authenticity of these documents is not recognized by the Vatican.  
Access and interpretation are left to the discretion of the reader.
